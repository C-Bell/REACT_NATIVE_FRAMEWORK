## React-Native Interactive Prototype

This application will be a react-native based project so I can
get to grips with the capabilities of React-Native.

To run the application, clone the repository and run: 

```
npm install
webpack -w
react-native run-android
```

Leave a terminal open running this command when running the
app and making react-native-router-flux src changes.
